# About

We are an international network of students and young professionals. We seek to cultivate relationships and leadership skills through volunteering in our community and communities around the world.

More specifically, **Rotaract** clubs are part of a global network of the largest service organization in the world. Our service efforts start at the community level but know no limits in its outreach. Rotaractors have access to the many resources of Rotary International (RI) and The Rotary Foundation. The purpose of Rotaract is to provide an opportunity for young men and women (ages 18-30ish) to enhance the skills that will assist in the personal development, to address the needs of their local communities, and to promote better relations between all people worldwide through international service.

If you are interested in helping the community, we create local projects and help with other non-governmental organizations. If you are interested in making new friends, our friendly members hold social events. If you are interested in professional development, we offer conferences and attend international conferences. If you are interested in opportunities to travel abroad, our international projects will take you all over the world to volunteer with other similar-minded Rotaractors from the worldwide Rotaract network. Rotaract will provide you with the chance to change the world!
