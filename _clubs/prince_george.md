    who_we_are: |
        The Rotaract Club of Prince George is a community-based club comprised of students and young professionals. As a relatively new club, they are hoping to become more involved in the community through volunteering and expressing a voice on important issues in the community. They believe that with diversity and unity, any issue can be tackled and positive change can be created. Their core values include creating positive relationships and professional skills and taking part in diverse experiences.
