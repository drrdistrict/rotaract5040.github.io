    who_we_are: |
        The Vancouver Young Professionals Rotaract Club cares deeply about three things: 1) giving back to our communities, 2) developing leadership, and 3) strengthening our friendships. As part of Rotary International, we leverage the Rotary network to support our three goals. We meet regularly to socialize, learn, network and organize volunteer/philanthropic projects.

        The Vancouver Young Professionals Rotaract Club is growing and we are seeking new members. We are an active, open and welcoming group of people who would love to see you at our next social event, meeting or fundraiser. Come along, meet our team and learn what Rotaract is all about. There is absolutely no obligation to join.

        Sponsored by the [Rotary Club of Vancouver](https://portal.clubrunner.ca/777).

    what_we_do: |
        The Vancouver Young Professionals Rotaract Club volunteers within the community for local organizations such as the [Salvation Army](http://www.harbourlightbc.com/). We also work hard to fundraise for international organizations such as [ShelterBox](https://www.shelterboxcanada.org/).

        One of the most important aspects of Rotaract is leadership development. Our club’s executive team, which is elected on an annual basis, consists of nine members who are able to develop their leadership skills in a variety of ways through their role on the team.

        No matter what we’re doing, we’re having fun and working as a team. That has led to strong friendships within our club. If you want to join the Rotaract family, we would be happy to have you on our team!

    meetings: Meetings are held the first Monday of each month from 6:00pm to 8:00pm online via ZOOM until further notice. For a link to the meeting, please email us or message us on social media.
