    who_we_are: |
        The Rotaract Club of Vancouver Yaletown is a small but dedicated group of students and young professionals. Chartered during the summer of 2009, RCVY is the first Rotaract club in the downtown Vancouver area. With emphasis on leadership and professional development, the club was formed with the main vision of providing service and giving back to the Yaletown community.

    what_we_do: |
        With most of our members being students it’s not a shock that most of our activities are directly related to the school. We perform annual fundraisers – for example our St Patrick’s Day bake sale and our Valentine’s Day coupon sale.

        Our main areas of service would be our visits to the Salvation Army food line on the last Saturday of every month. We have also coordinated and assisted in multiple shoreline clean ups just to name a few.

        We strongly believe in providing opportunities for personal and group development equipping our members with tools that would allow them to not only help but make a positive change.

    meetings: The home of our bi-monthly regular meetings is the Fairleigh Dickenson University’s downtown campus (842 Cambie Street, Vancouver). The meetings are held on every other Monday at 6pm. Usually it would last for an hour allowing us to recap on the months events and also plan for the upcoming weeks. We are truly motivated to make a positive difference in each and every way.
