### PACE 2021

It certainly is unprecedented times. Due to the nature of the world and uncertainty of travel later this year, the PACE 2021 trip will not be happening this year. We hold onto hope to be able to welcome international Rotaractors in 2022. Stay tuned to our social media at the end of August for a local version of PACE.


### PACE 2020: Update

After careful consideration, and the uncertain times ahead, the PACE 2020 trip has been cancelled. We are devastated to not host this year, but out of an abundance of caution and safety we believe it is necessary to postpone this year. Please watch our website in early 2021 for the next trip. Thank you for understanding.

### PACE 2020: August 20 – August 31

The Pacific Canada Experience with Rotaract (PACE) is a roundtrip that fosters global Rotaract ties and provides an authentic experience of Canada’s multiculturalism while facilitating international friendships.

Spearheaded by Rotaract 5040, and in partnership with Rotaract 5020, six international Rotaractors will partake in activities featuring our unique mix of nature, city, and eco-friendly living. Kayaking around Vancouver, hiking the Grouse Grind, touring Victoria (our provincial capital), exploring Whistler Village and volunteering locally with local Rotaractors are just a few of the exciting events planned on this 10-day program.

We hope you will join us for this exciting adventure into Pacific Canada’s beautiful landscape, cultural diversity, and active lifestyle.

### 2020 Participants

Six Rotaractors from around the world, ages 19-30, will be invited to join us on a trip of a lifetime with PACE following a successful application process. Participants should arrive by the evening of Thursday, August 20th to be ready to start the program the morning of Friday, August 21st, and depart on Monday, August 31st, 2020.

Through sponsorship from Rotaract District 5040 and local Rotary Clubs, PACE will cost each participant $465 CAD. This fee covers 3 meals daily, activity fees, accommodation and transportation. Personal expenses – such as souvenirs, roundtrip airfare, and international health insurance – are not included in the participation fee.

Past year’s plans included visiting the following cities: Vancouver, Burnaby, Richmond, Victoria, Squamish, Whistler, North Vancouver, Coquitlam, and Port Moody.

### Physical Activity Advisory

British Columbia is known for its breathtaking green landscape and outdoor activities. To provide an authentic Pacific Canada experience with PACE, there are two planned hikes, which are physically challenging. All successful applicants must be generally healthy and fit and ideally, exercise on a regular basis. The hikes will elevate heart rates, however, anyone from 5 years old to 80 years old can accomplish it with some fitness, water, hiking shoes or runners, a positive attitude, and perseverance.

Note: As our intention is to deliver the best Pacific Canada Experience, all successful participants are expected to participate in the scheduled activities to the best of their ability.

### The Pacific Canadian Province of British Columbia

The Pacific Canada region is located by the Coast Mountain Range and Pacific Ocean and offers the perfect balance of city and nature. This metropolitan area is the third largest in the world but is also home to the breathtaking natural scenery of lush green forests, towering mountains and vivid sunsets over the horizon of a deep blue ocean. The Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games have further transformed the area into a vibrant centre with a buzzing nightlife.

Vancouver has been ranked among one of the most livable cities worldwide for more than a decade. Its ability to maintain this ranking can be attributed to its leadership in green initiatives, eco-friendliness, and sustainability. This multicultural city also caters to a diverse group of people. Often referred to as a “city of neighbourhoods“, Vancouver offers an array of ethnic commercial areas, each having their own distinct character and taste. If you enjoy the outdoors and cultural neighbourhoods, the Pacific Canada region is your gateway to adventure. Come join us for the experience of a lifetime!
